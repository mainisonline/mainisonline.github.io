  <h1>TANK Ultimate</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">fixed media · year: 2021</div>
  <p><em>Developed under the mentorship of multimedia artist Vjeran Šalamon.</em></p>

  <p><strong>TANK Ultimate</strong> is an electroacoustic piece signifying a war tank passing through an empty field.</p>
  <p>I like to keep my pieces open to interpretation. With that in mind, this project was made as a programmatic composition. It is a story that follows a war tank passing through an empty field. It is told from the point of view of one of the gunners on said tank. During the ride across, his mental state deteriorates. He has visions of the opposite forces attacking them. However, in reality, nothing happens. They pass the empty field without any confrontations.</p>

  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <p>FL Studio was used as the main working station. Audio samples were mostly self-recorded. An old guitar was used for many of the samples—strings were played at the bridge and the headstock. Metal objects were used to slide around the frets. The guitar’s body was hit with fingers and smaller objects.</p>
  <p>Samples were time stretched, micro-looped, and used for granular synthesis. Granular synthesis was done in FL Studio and in SuperCollider. The code used for SuperCollider was found online.</p>
